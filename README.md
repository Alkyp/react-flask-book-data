Using Flask for Backend and React for Frontend in Building a Simple Book Data Web Application

Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, is commonly used for backend development, while React, a JavaScript library, is popular for building interactive user interfaces on the frontend. Combining these two technologies allows for the creation of a simple book data web application with efficient data handling and a responsive UI.

Backend: Flask
Flask will serve as the backend API, handling book data storage, retrieval, and management. The backend will include:

A REST API with endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting book data.
A SQLite or PostgreSQL database for storing book information.
Flask's built-in development server to handle requests from the frontend.
Frontend: React
React will be used to build the frontend interface, allowing users to interact with the book data. The frontend will include:

A book listing page displaying book details.
A form for adding new books.
Functionality for editing and deleting books.
Fetch API or Axios for communicating with the Flask backend.
Integration
The React frontend will send requests to the Flask backend via API calls (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Flask will process these requests, interact with the database, and return JSON responses to the frontend, ensuring seamless data flow.
